# Great Step Cultivation Overview

The Heaven & Earth setting features colossal leaps in power known simply as
"Steps." Each Step represents a cultivator breaking another set of shackles
imposed by The Heavens and grasping progressively more complete control over Dao
and cosmic law. The outline below captures the narrative and mechanical themes
for the most storied four Steps.

## First Step – Immortality's Threshold

* **Essence:** Shedding mortality and entering the first layer of immortality.
* **Longevity:** Lifespans lengthen dramatically but remain finite, determined by
  how tightly The Heavens of a realm restrict ascension.
* **Signature Feats:**
  * Wield supernatural abilities that clearly separate them from mundane
    mortals.
  * At peak mastery can devastate an entire cultivation planet—worlds that rival
    real-world solar systems in scope.

First Step cultivators concentrate on anchoring their new immortal bodies and
qi foundations. Their abilities may vary wildly, but each technique reinforces
that they are no longer bound by the limits of baseline human existence.

## Second Step – World Law Artisans

* **Essence:** Bridging the gap between self and Dao by aligning with the
  natural laws of their realm.
* **Longevity:** Lifespans are functionally limitless but are suppressed to
  finite spans through heavenly laws, divine tribulations, and calamities.
* **Signature Feats:**
  * Shape and manipulate the world's elemental, life, and death forces with
    frightening precision.
  * Annihilate cultivation planets, extinguish starry skies, destroy galaxies,
    and spark supernovae or similar cosmic phenomena.

Cultivators at this Step pursue the cultivation of vitality, fate, and ambient
energies. Their efforts refine the world itself, setting the groundwork to
comprehend and eventually cultivate the Dao directly.

## Third Step – Dao Sovereigns

* **Essence:** Direct cultivation and embodiment of Dao, wielding at least one
  perfected Essence.
* **Longevity:** Detached from the binding threads of space, time, fate, and the
  universe; existence persists even if severed from all four.
* **Signature Feats:**
  * Destroy entire universes with minimal exertion.
  * Shape reality through Essence mastery—reversing real and unreal, traversing
    or manipulating infinite-dimensional spaces, and more.

Only a handful of realms even possess records of 3rd Step cultivators. Those who
reach this plateau have conclusively mastered their Dao and stand near the peak
of most cosmic hierarchies.

## Fourth Step – Transcendent Overlords

* **Essence:** Beings whose very existence embodies Essence, Dao, and natural
  law.
* **Longevity:** Stand outside conventional measures; even other Step cultivators
  cannot fully comprehend their presence.
* **Signature Feats:**
  * Create, redefine, or erase Essences, Daos, and laws with a thought.
  * Serve as the apex authority of Dao Domains, commanding reverence across the
    greater Universe.

Fourth Step cultivators eclipse all prior measures of power. They transcend the
framework used to describe lesser realms and are considered titans even in the
widest cosmic contexts.
